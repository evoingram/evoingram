## About Me

My name's Erica Ingram, and I am a recent Lambda School grad seeking a position as I transition careers.  I've been a hard worker and leader by example my whole life.  My first job was [detasseling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3Ar4sdL-JI#t=0m27s) for four full seasons, and I was given a promotion to supervisor before even the end of the first season.  In my past, I've done lots of different things; worked in retail, customer service, as a project manager @ Kinkos, run a news department for a gaming league with a readership of over 500k, and had a book published as well as articles featured on the front cover of both Massive and Computer Games Magazines.  
<p>
I am a leader by example even when I am doing things for fun.  For a year and a half, I belonged to a guild in World of Warcraft which was 25th in the U.S. out of upwards of 10,000 guilds to clear Sunwell Plateau, and was present for and participated in each and every boss kill.  I was known for combat log analysis and helped mentor junior raiders by deeply analyzing logs and collaborating with other guildies to help juniors improve their rotations.
</p>

I've run my own court transcription business remotely for over a decade.  My company's transcripts are truly unique and have features that none other does, which help people to achieve more.  For several years of owning my business, I developed software using VB and MySQL to automate a large chunk of it, and then [wrote a few blog posts](https://transcription.aquoco.co/) describing how to do some of the things I did.  The software integrates with Word, Excel, OneNote, Publisher, Outlook, Express Scribe, FTR Player, Acrobat, and Paypal, among others (also with Wunderlist when that was still a thing).  I built a speech recognition engine using batch files and PocketSphinx, and then integrated that engine into my database.  I cleaned up and automated feeding all the data (audio and transcripts) so it could learn.  I loved doing all that so much that, when I found Lambda, I knew what I needed to do, and I made the leap.  For six of the nine months at Lambda, I went to school 40 hours a week, served as team lead in the evenings 16-20 hours per week, and ran my business in between.

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

During Lambda, I:

- had over 1,200 hours of hands-on development/coding time.
- overhauled [my company's website](https://www.aquoco.co), [code here](https://github.com/evoingram/newAQCWebsite/), which now scores 91 in performance and 100 in accessibility, SEO, and best practices in Lighthouse reports.  
- ported my [VB-MySQL database](https://github.com/evoingram/vbDatabase) to an online version.  The 126-endpoint [Node.js and PostgreSQL back end](https://github.com/evoingram/webapp-backend) has full and complete documentation and testing via Postman, schema, product vision document for the overall software, UML diagrams, etc.
- made a [portfolio](http://www.ericaingram.com) ([code here](https://github.com/evoingram/portfolio)), a pretty cool piece of art themed around Olympic National Park, a place close to where I live.  It's heavy on CSS animation.  Try clicking on the sun to see the moon and twinkling stars!
- built a [React/Redux clone](https://nasasearchclone.now.sh/), [code here](https://github.com/evoingram/nasaSearch), of the NASA images library, which is not in React/Redux.
- built a [Cortana bot](https://github.com/evoingram/cortanaBot).
- built a [Conway's Game of Life app](https://cs-bw.now.sh/) in React, [code here](https://github.com/evoingram/cs-bw).
- prepared PowerPoint presentations and presented those to the product owner to get approval of product vision and release canvasses via Zoom.
- gave presentations on supplemental content to teach students how to build certain apps.
- on the side learned Java, TypeScript, Docker, UML, advanced Postman, advanced Agile methodology, PowerShell, advanced VB, system design, scalability, and object-oriented design patterns.
- received 14 references/recommendations, seven on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aquocotrans/) and seven more via [Searchlight](https://github.com/evoingram/evoingram/blob/master/Reference%20Report%20for%20Erica%20Ingram.pdf), a third-party service which hides nearly all the recommender's content from the recommendee in order to encourage candor, which may be sent on request via e-mail.
- had over 5,500 GitHub contributions & 2.4 million lines of code in the last year.
- studied data structures and algorithms in the core curriculum, in CTCI, and via Leetcode [on the side](https://github.com/evoingram/endorsement), mostly in Python, for many, many hours.
- studied 40-ish system designs to learn system architecture as well as reading Clean Architecture by Bob Martin and the scalability book by Ejsmont.
- studied the Gang of Four book and a lot of YouTube videos to learn about object-oriented design patterns.
- studied Clean Code and The Clean Coder by Bob Martin to learn more about how to write good code and how to be a true professional in the tech field.
- completed [Master the Mainframe 2019 Part Three](https://www.youracclaim.com/users/erica-ingram/badges) as well as a few other mainframe-related badges.

In every track at Lambda, each student goes through an eight-week 'apprenticeship'.  The student collaborates in two full continuous development cycles using Agile methodology from design through deployment, working in cross-functional teams.  I was responsible for all testing on the [project](https://github.com/evoingram/conference-contacts-fe/) as well as creating PowerPoint presentations and presenting the product vision and release canvasses to the product owner. 

As a team lead, in addition to the group I led for the core curriculum, I managed several 7-10-member Agile teams, sometimes international and sometimes including developers from other tracks like Data Science, through what are called build weeks, where each cross-functional team has seven days to produce a working software product from design through deployment.  I hosted 1:1s with each of my core-curriculum students twice per week.

Now I've been endorsed by Lambda, and am seeking a position in the tech field.  I will take my resourcefulness, discipline, empathy, respect, problem-solving ability, teamwork, and grit with me wherever I land.  If you hire me, I will always bring my A game, worth every penny and more.

## Resources

[Here are my notes and some extra tips and resources](https://github.com/evoingram/endorsement) I've picked up along the way at Lambda related to learning, interviewing, and job-searching.  It includes:

- lots of data structures and algorithm problems 
- lots of data structures and algorithm samples in Python & gifs
- all my notes for everything I've ever studied in the tech field
- many, many Anki flash card decks
- cheat sheets
- video playlists
- book lists
- other resources such as the top 50 behavioral interview questions, coding challenge patterns, general self-study questions, various social media posts related to being a new developer, getting the most out of 1:1s, tutorials I like, etc.

It's in progress and developing daily.
