### Hello there, ðŸ‘‹

My name's Erica Ingram, and I'm a software engineer seeking a position.

As a solo entrepreneur, I needed a website and VB software to process work product, but didnâ€™t have capital to hire a developer, so I learned to code instead. A few macros to solve a given problem here and there turned into a complete software package. Thereâ€™s a lot of details to attend to because youâ€™re every department, and it can be easy to miss things, so having software you can rely upon to solve your pain points and make your workflow efficient and complete from end to end is crucial, which I leaned into when creating my companyâ€™s software. The software gave me back 15 hours of my life per week, and since I implemented it by far my most frequent customer compliment is how thorough I am.

I enjoyed creating this software so much, I decided to attend Lambda, and now that I've completed the program, Iâ€™m very excited to bring my resourcefulness and problem-solving skills to my next venture. 

I'm ALWAYS hustling, always have things to learn and do, so [here's what I'm currently working on](https://github.com/users/evoingram/projects/2).
