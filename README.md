## Hello there, ðŸ‘‹

My name's Erica Ingram, and I am a recent Lambda School grad seeking a position as I transition careers.  I've been a hard worker and leader by example my whole life.  My first job was detasseling for four full seasons, and I was given a promotion to supervisor before even the end of the first season.  In my past, I've done lots of different things; worked in retail, customer service, as a project manager @ Kinkos, run a news department for a gaming league with a readership of over 500k, and had a book published as well as articles featured on the front cover of both Massive and Computer Games Magazines.  

I am a leader by example even when I am doing things for fun.  For a year and a half, I belonged to a guild in World of Warcraft which was 25th in the U.S. out of upwards of 10,000 guilds to clear Sunwell Plateau, and was present for and participated in each and every boss kill.  I was known for combat log analysis and helped mentor junior raiders by deeply analyzing logs and collaborating with other guildies to help juniors improve their rotations.

I've run my own court transcription business for over a decade.  My company's transcripts are truly unique and have features that none other does, which help people to achieve more.  For several years of owning my business, I developed software using VB and MySQL to automate a large chunk of it, and then wrote a few blog posts describing how to do some of the things I did.  The software integrates with Word, Excel, Publisher, Outlook, Express Scribe, FTR Player, Acrobat, and Paypal, among others (also with Wunderlist when that was still a thing).  I built a speech recognition engine using batch files and PocketSphinx, and then integrated that engine into my database.  I cleaned up and automated feeding all the data (audio and transcripts) so it could learn.  I loved doing all that so much that, when I found Lambda, I knew what I needed to do.

During Lambda, I:

- overhauled [my company's website](https://www.aquoco.co), [code here](https://github.com/evoingram/newAQCWebsite/), which now scores 91 in performance and 100 in accessibility, SEO, and best practices in Lighthouse reports.  
- ported my [VB-MySQL database](https://github.com/evoingram/vbDatabase) to an online version.  The [Node.js and PostgreSQL back end](https://github.com/evoingram/webapp-backend) has full and complete documentation and testing via Postman, schema, product vision document for the overall software, etc.
- made a [portfolio](http://www.ericaingram.com) ([code here](https://github.com/evoingram/portfolio)), a pretty cool piece of art themed around Olympic National Park, a place close to where I live.  It's heavy on CSS animation.  Try clicking on the sun to see the moon and stars!
- built a [React/Redux clone](https://nasasearchclone.now.sh/), [code here](https://github.com/evoingram/nasaSearch), of the NASA images library, which is not in React/Redux, also available in the pinned items below.
- built a [Cortana bot](https://github.com/evoingram/cortanaBot).
- built a [Conway's Game of Life app](https://cs-bw.now.sh/), [code here](https://github.com/evoingram/cs-bw).
- presented product vision and release canvasses for approval to the product owner.
- gave presentations on supplemental content to teach students how to build certain apps.
- on the side learned Java, TypeScript, Docker, UML, advanced Postman, advanced Agile methodology, PowerShell, advanced VB, system design, scalability, and object-oriented design patterns.
- received 14 references/recommendations while at school, seven on LinkedIn and seven more via Searchlight, a third-party service which hides the recommender's content from the recommendee.
- had over 4,100 GitHub contributions over the last year.
- studied data structures and algorithms, CTCI, and Leetcode [on the side](https://github.com/evoingram/endorsement), mostly in Python, for many, many hours.

For six of the nine months at Lambda, I went to school 40 hours a week, served as team lead in the evenings 16-20 hours per week, and ran my business in between.  Now I've been endorsed by Lambda, and am seeking a position in the tech field.  As always, I will take my attitude, discipline, empathy, respect, problem-solving ability, teamwork, and grit with me wherever I land.  If you hire me, I will always bring my A game, and I will be worth every penny.

[Here are my notes and some extra tips and resources](https://github.com/evoingram/endorsement) I've picked up along the way at Lambda related to learning, interviewing, and job-searching.  It includes:

- lots of data structures and algorithm problems 
- lots of data structures and algorithm samples in Python & gifs
- all my notes for everything I've ever studied in the tech field
- many, many Anki flash card decks
- cheat sheets
- video playlists
- book lists
- other resources such as the top 50 behavioral interview questions, coding challenge patterns, general self-study questions, various social media posts related to being a new developer, getting the most out of 1:1s, tutorials I like, etc.

It's in progress and developing daily.
